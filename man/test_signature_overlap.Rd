\title{Signature overlap calculation}
\usage{
test_signature_overlap(selected_signatures, model = eADAGEmodel)
}
\arguments{
\item{selected_signatures}{a vector storing names of signatures selected
to be tested.}

\item{model}{an ADAGE model to extract signatures from
(default: the 300-node eADAGE model preloaded in the pacakge).}
}
\value{
a named list storing odds ratios for all pairs of signature overlap
tests.
}
\description{
Tests how significant all possible pairs of input signatures
overlap with each other in term of their gene compositions.
